## Requirements

- **VPS Architecture**: **AMD64** or **ARM64** _(recommended: 2 vCPUs and 2GB RAM)_.
- **Supported OS**: **Ubuntu (20+)**, **Debian (10+)**, **Fedora (37+)**.
- `git` and `curl` packages installed on the server:
```bash
sudo apt update -q && sudo apt install -yq git curl
```


## Services

### `xray-config`
Creates `config.json`, monitors configurations, and export Xray configurations via `/metrics` path.

### `xray`
Reads `config.json` from the **xray-config** service and runs the Xray-core.

### `v2ray-exporter`
Exports V2Ray/Xray configuration metrics.

### `node-exporter`
Prometheus Node Exporter that collects all critical metrics of the agent machine.

### `nginx`
NGINX webserver to manage Xray inbounds and fallbacks, enhancing both performance and security.

### `metric-forwarder`
Reads metrics from `xray-config`, `node-exporter`, and `v2ray-exporter` services and pushes them to a remote manager `Pushgateway` service or `Grafana Cloud Prometheus` endpoint.

## Setup Manager
Please follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/compassvpn/manager) to create a manager. You can choose between the following options:
- Grafana Cloud
- Hosted Grafana + Prometheus

Ensure you obtain the authentication values from the manager setup. These values will be required to be included in the `env_file` of the agent.


# How to run

The following services must be run on a VPS you intend to use as a VPN server.

## Clone

1. ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/compassvpn/agent.git
      ```
2. ```bash
      cd agent
      ```

## Configure `env_file`

1. Copy the example file to `env_file`, the program's required configuration file:
      ```
      cp env_file.example env_file
      ```

2. Set `METRIC_PUSH_METHOD` to either `pushgateway` or `grafana_cloud`, based on your chosen Manager option.

3. if `METRIC_PUSH_METHOD=grafana_agent` _(set during the manager setup: [Option 1](https://github.com/compassvpn/manager?tab=readme-ov-file#option-1-use-garafana-cloud))_
      - set `GRAFANA_AGENT_REMOTE_WRITE_URL` _(Grafana remote URL)_
      - set `GRAFANA_AGENT_REMOTE_WRITE_USER` _(Grafana user)_
      - set `GRAFANA_AGENT_REMOTE_WRITE_PASSWORD` _(Grafana token password)_

4. if `METRIC_PUSH_METHOD=pushgateway` _(set during the manager setup: [Option 2](https://github.com/compassvpn/manager?tab=readme-ov-file#option-2-deploy-your-own-server))_
      - set `PUSHGATEWAY_URL` _(pushgateway URL)_
      - set `PUSHGATEWAY_AUTH_USER` _(pushgateway basic auth user)_
      - set `PUSHGATEWAY_AUTH_PASSWORD` _(pushgateway basic auth password)_

5. Set `DONOR=noname` _(used as a label in Prometheus metrics)_.

6. Set `REDEPLOY_INTERVAL` _(resets `IDENTIFIER` and generates new configurations at each interval, e.g., `1d` for 1 day, `14d` for every two weeks)_.

7. Set `IPINFO_API_TOKEN` _(Optional, signup at [ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/signup))_

8. Set `CF_ENABLE` to:
      - `true` to include Cloudflare CDN configuration links alongside other configs.
      - `false` to skip generating Cloudflare CDN configs.

9. Set `CF_ONLY` to:
      - `true` if the server's IP is filtered or not clean.
      - `false` to allow direct configurations without Cloudflare.

10. Configure Cloudflare `CF_API_TOKEN` and `CF_ZONE_ID`:
      - `CF_API_TOKEN`: Create this token for one zone at [Cloudflare API Token Setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/).
      - `CF_ZONE_ID`: Use the Zone ID selected when creating the API token.

11. Set `SSL_PROVIDER` to `letsencrypt` or `zerossl` (depending on your preferred SSL certificate provider):

12. Set `XRAY_OUTBOUND` to:
      - `direct` for direct outbound connections.
      - `warp` for [WARP](https://one.one.one.one) outbound connections.

13. Set `XRAY_INBOUNDS` to your desired inbound configurations, as defined in inbounds.json.
      
      Supported Inbounds:
      - `vless-tcp-tls-direct`
      - `vless-hu-tls-direct`
      - `vless-hu-tls-cdn`
      - _(Default when not set: `vless-tcp-tls-direct,vless-hu-tls-direct,vless-hu-tls-cdn`)_

14. Set `AUTO_UPDATE` to:
      - `on` to enable automatic updates.
      - `off` to disable automatic updates _(default if not provided or commented out)_.

15. Configure `NGINX`:
      - Set `NGINX_PATH`: Any value is fine; it just needs to be present as firewalls won't see it.
      - Set `NGINX_FAKE_WEBSITE`. Use a site relevant to your VPS region, avoiding Cloudflare CDN websites.

16. Set `CUSTOM_DNS` to:
      - `default`: Use the VPS default DNS servers.
      - `cf`: Use the [CloudFlare Security DoH](https://security.cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query): Will block Malware services.
      - `controld`: Use the [ControlD free DoH](https://freedns.controld.com/no-ads-dating-drugs-gambling-malware-typo/): Will block Ads, Dating, Drugs, Gambling, Malware services.
      - `custom`: Use any DNS server you wish to provide, with support for DoU, DoT, DoH, and DoQ. For each, input as follows:

      DoU: `CUSTOM_DNS=76.76.2.2`

      DoT: `CUSTOM_DNS=tls+local://p2.freedns.controld.com`

      DoH: `CUSTOM_DNS=https+local://freedns.controld.com/p2`

      DoQ: `CUSTOM_DNS=quic+local://p2.freedns.controld.com`
